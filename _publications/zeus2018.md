Microservices have been one of the fastest-rising trends inthe development of enterprise applications and enterprise applicationlandscapes. Even though various mapping studies investigated the openchallenges around microservices from literature, it is difficult to have aclear view of existing challenges in designing, developing, and maintainingsystems based on microservices architecture as it is perceived by practi-tioners. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical survey toassess the current state of practice and collect challenges in microservicesarchitecture. Therefore, we synthesize the 25 collected results and producea clear overview for answering our research questions. The result of ourstudy can be a basis for planning future research and applications ofmicroservices architecture.
