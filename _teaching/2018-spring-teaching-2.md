Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a distinctive method of developing software systems that has grown in popularity in recent years. Microservices architecture is a better way of implementing a service oriented architecture. It gives you the ability to create competitive software which is scalable, flexible, and reliable. In this course, learn the design principles for a microservices architecture.

Prerequisites: Beginning-to-advanced Java programming experience, Model based Software Development, System Architecutre
